Additionally, it adds some options to the conf.json file that gives\nyou even more flexibility to tweak the template to your needs. It will also make your teeth whiter.\n\n## Features ##\n* Fixed navigation at page top\n* Right side TOC for navigation in pages\n* Themed\n* Customizable\n\n### What It Looks Like ###\nHere are examples of this template with the different Bootswatch themes:\n\n+ [Amelia](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/amelia)\n+ [Cerulean](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/cerulean)\n+ [Cosmo](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/cosmo)\n+ [Cyborg](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/cyborg)\n+ [Flatly](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/flatly)\n+ [Journal](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/journal)\n+ [Readable](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/readable)\n+ [Simplex](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/simplex)\n+ [Slate](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/slate)\n+ [Spacelab](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/spacelab)\n+ [Spruce](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/spruce)\n+ [Superhero](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/superhero)\n+ [United](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/united)\n\nTo change your theme, just change it in the `conf.json` file. See below for details.\n## Ooooh, I want it! How do I get it?##\nFirst grab the [zip file from github.](https://github.com/terryweiss/docstrap/archive/master.zip) Unzip it\nto your favorite hard drive and ask JSDoc to use it. Like so:\n\n\t<path/to/jsdoc>/jsoc mysourcefiles/* -t <path.to.unzipped>/template -c <path.to.unzipped>/conf.json -d <path.to.output>/\n\nAlso take a gander at [JSDoc's command line options](http://usejsdoc.org/about-commandline.html).\n\n## Configuring the template ##\n\nDocStrap ships with a `conf.json` file in the template/ directory. It is just a regular old\n[JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html), but with the following new options:\n```\n\"templates\": {\n\t\"systemName\"      : \"{string}\",\n\t\"footer\"          : \"{string}\",\n\t\"copyright\"       : \"{string}\",\n\t\"navType\"         : \"{vertical|inline}\",\n\t\"theme\"           : \"{theme}\",\n\t\"linenums\"        : {boolean},\n\t\"collapseSymbols\" : {boolean},\n\t\"inverseNav\"      : {boolean}\n}\n```\n### Options ###\n\n*   __systemName__\n\tThe name of the system being documented. This will appear in the page title for each page\n*   __footer__\n\tAny markup want to appear in the footer of each page. This is not processed at all, just printed exactly as you enter it\n*   __copyright__\n\tYou can add a copyright message below the _footer_ and above the JSDoc timestamp at the bottom of the page\n*   __navType__\n\tThe template uses top level navigation with dropdowns for the contents of each category. On large systems these dropdowns\n\tcan get large enough to expand beyond the page. To make the dropdowns render wider and stack the entries vertically, set this\n\toption to `\"inline\"`. Otherwise set it to `\"vertical\"` to make them regular stacked dropdowns.\n*   __theme__\n\tThis is the name of the them you want to use **in all lowercase**. The valid options are\n\t+ `amelia`\n\t+ `cerulean`\n\t+ `cosmo`\n\t+ `cyborg`\n\t+ `flatly`\n\t+ `journal`\n\t+ `readable`\n\t+ `simplex`\n\t+ `slate`\n\t+ `spacelab`\n\t+ `spruce`\n\t+ `superhero`\n\t+ `united`\n*   __linenums__\n\tWhen true, line numbers will appear in the source code listing. If you have\n\t[also turned that on](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html).\n*   __collapseSymbols__\n\tIf your pages have a large number of symbols, it can be easy to get lost in all the text. If you turn this to `true`\n\tall of the symbols in the page will roll their contents up so that you just get a list of symbols that can be expanded\n\tand collapsed.\n*   __inverseNav__\n\tBootstrap navbars come in two flavors, regular and inverse where inverse is generally higher contrast. Set this to `true` to\n\tuse the inverse header.\n\n## Customizing DocStrap ##\nNo template can meet every need and customizing templates is a favorite pastime of....well, no-one, but you may need to anyway.\nFirst make sure you have [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) and [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.\nFetch the source using `git` or grab the [zip file from github.](https://github.com/terryweiss/docstrap/archive/master.zip) and unzip\nit somewhere. Everything that follows happens in the unzip directory.\n\nNext, prepare the environment:\n\n    bower install\n\nand\n\n    grunt install\n\nWhen that is done, you have all of the tools to start modifying the template. The template, like Bootstrap, used [less](http://lesscss.org/).\nThe way it works is that `./styles/main.less` pulls in the bootstrap files uncompiled so that you have access to all of bootstraps mixins, colors,\netc, that you would want. There are two more files in that directory, `variables.less`, `bootswatch.less`. These are the\ntheme files and you can modify them, but keep in mind that if you apply a new theme (see below) those files will be overwritten. It is best\nto keep your changes to the `main.less` file.\n\nTo compile your changes to `main.less` and any other files it loads up,\n\n\tgrunt less\n\nThe output is will be put in `./template/static/styles/site.<theme-name>.css`. The next time you create your documentation, it\nwill have the new css file included.\n\nTo apply a different template to the `styles` directory to modify, open up the `conf.json` in the template directory and\nchange the `theme` option to the theme you want. Then\n\n\tgrunt apply\n\nAnd the new theme will be in `variables.less`, `bootswatch.less`. Don't forget to compile your changes using `grunt apply` to\nget that change into the template.\n\n**NOTE** that these steps are not necessary to just change the theme, this is only to modify the theme. If all you want to do is\nchange the theme, just update conf.json with the new theme and build your docs!\n\n## Contributing ##\nYes! Contribute! Test! Share your ideas!
